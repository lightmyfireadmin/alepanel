# Reference Analysis & Inspiration for Alecia Panel

## Overview
This document analyzes three reference projects (`twenty`, `monica`, `openblocks`) found in the codebase to extract architectural patterns, features, and UX inspirations for the next phases of the Alecia Panel development.

## 1. Twenty (The #1 Open-Source CRM)
**Source:** `_references/twenty`
**Stack:** React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Recoil

### Key Features & Inspiration
- **Customizable Views (Table/Kanban/List):**
  - *Relevance:* Critical for the **Deal Flow** pipeline. Alecia needs to view deals as a Kanban board (stages: Lead -> NDA -> Offer -> Closing) and as a data-rich Table for filtering by sector/revenue.
  - *Action:* Implement a "View Switcher" component for the Deals section.

- **Object Customization:**
  - *Relevance:* M&A deals vary by type (Sell-side, Buy-side, Fundraising).
  - *Action:* flexible data schema (using JSONB or EAV pattern if needed, though Drizzle handles schema well) to allow custom fields per deal type.

- **Activity Timeline:**
  - *Relevance:* Every deal has a history of emails, calls, and meetings.
  - *Action:* A central "Activity Feed" component for both Deals and Contacts (Companies/Buyers).

## 2. Monica (Personal Relationship Management)
**Source:** `_references/monica-main`
**Stack:** Laravel/Vue (Concept is stack-agnostic)

### Key Features & Inspiration
- **"Relationship" Focus vs. "Transactional" Focus:**
  - *Relevance:* M&A is high-touch. It's not just about "closing"; it's about the relationship with the CEO/Founder.
  - *Action:* Add "Context" fields to contacts: "How we met", "Last interaction", "Personal notes" (spouse name, hobbies - crucial for building rapport in long deals).

- **Reminders & Frequency:**
  - *Relevance:* "Stay in touch" reminders.
  - *Action:* Automated reminders to follow up with a lead if no interaction has happened in X days.

- **Simplicity & Privacy:**
  - *Relevance:* "For your eyes only". M&A data is highly sensitive.
  - *Action:* Strict RLS (Row Level Security) or application-level permission checks (which we verified in `auth-users.ts`, but need to enforce on data fetching).

## 3. Openblocks (Internal Tool Builder)
**Source:** `_references/openblocks-develop`
**Stack:** React, Component Library

### Key Features & Inspiration
- **Dashboard Widgets & Components:**
  - *Relevance:* The Admin Dashboard needs to be modular.
  - *Action:* Build a library of reusable "Widgets" (e.g., `StatCard`, `DealChart`, `RecentActivityList`) that can be composed into different dashboard layouts.

- **Quick Actions (Command Palette):**
  - *Relevance:* Power users (Associates) need speed.
  - *Action:* We already have a `CommandPalette`. We should expand it to include actions like "Create new Deal", "Log Call", "Search Companies".

## Consolidated Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Enhanced Deal CRM (Inspired by Twenty)
- [ ] **Kanban View**: Implement drag-and-drop deal stages.
- [ ] **Deal Filters**: Advanced filtering (Sector, Revenue > X, EBITDA > Y).
- [ ] **Dynamic Columns**: Allow users to toggle visible columns in the Deal Table.

### Phase 3: Relationship Intelligence (Inspired by Monica)
- [ ] **Rich Contact Profiles**: Add "Personal Context" and "Interaction History" to `TeamMember` / `User` / `Contact` entities.
- [ ] **Smart Reminders**: "You haven't spoken to [Client Name] in 30 days."

### Phase 4: Dashboard Modularization (Inspired by Openblocks)
- [ ] **Widget System**: Abstract dashboard cards into a configuration-driven layout.
- [ ] **Data Visualizations**: Add charts for "Deal Volume by Sector", "Active Mandates per Associate".
