      "question": "What services does alecia offer?",
      "answer": "alecia is an M&A advisory firm, also known as a merger and acquisition advisor. We offer a range of specialized services for businesses, including divestiture, acquisition, merger, financing and fundraising. Thanks to our sector expertise and extensive networks, we support business owners and shareholders in identifying relevant counterparties (buyers, investors, lenders or acquisition targets), producing valuations and key information, negotiating terms and coordinating legal and tax advisors through to the successful completion of the transaction."
    },
    "differentiation": {
      "question": "How does alecia differentiate from other financial advisors?",
      "answer": "alecia stands out in several ways. First, we take an inter-professional approach by forming an integrated team of your various advisors (accountant, specialized lawyers in business and tax law, wealth managers, etc.) from the start of the transaction. We also guarantee the continuous involvement of two experienced partners throughout the assignment, ensuring constant expertise and responsiveness. Our entrepreneurial backgrounds allow us to intimately understand the daily life of business owners, adding valuable perspective to our support. Finally, our expertise in financial engineering and our multi-sector dimension enable us to build solutions tailored to each situation."
    },
    "sectors": {
      "question": "Do you specialize in a particular sector?",
      "answer": "We combine the experiences of our partners to provide multi-sector expertise and deep knowledge of their ecosystems. We operate in the following areas: agri-food, distribution and consumer and business services, real estate and construction, industries, healthcare, financial services and insurance, technology and software, as well as companies with environmental and/or social impact."
    },
    "fees": {
      "question": "How are your fees calculated?",
      "answer": "Our remuneration is divided into two parts. First, initial fees are paid upon signing a mandate. Their amount is limited and serves to formalize our mutual commitment to the transaction. Then, the vast majority of our remuneration comes from success fees, calculated by applying a percentage to the transaction amount. This model ensures alignment of our interests with yours and guarantees our commitment throughout the assignment. The only exception concerns acquisition mandates, where success fees are based on the size of the target rather than the transaction amount, to maintain this alignment of interests."
    },
    "meaning": {
      "question": "What does alecia mean?",
      "answer": "alecia derives from the concept of aletheia, which embodies the notion of truth and reality. This name guides our approach based on three guiding principles: honesty, excellence and humility. These values drive us to be transparent in all our interactions and to commit to continuous improvement of our expertise and tools."
