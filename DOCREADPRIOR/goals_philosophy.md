# Goals & Philosophy - Alecia Panel

## Vision
**Alecia Panel** is a specialized "Business Operating System" designed for M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) advisory operations. It manages the lifecycle of PME/ETI (Small and Medium Enterprises) acquisition and sale processes in France.

## Philosophy
- **Operational Excellence:** Provides a structured workflow for M&A advisors to manage leads, mandates, and transactions.
- **Data-Driven Advisory:** Integrates web crawling and AI (Mistral, Groq) to enrich company data and provide insights for valuation and matching.
- **Enterprise-Grade Privacy:** Uses strict authentication (NextAuth) and data modeling (Drizzle/Neon) to handle sensitive financial and corporate information.
- **Scalable Automation:** Designed to automate repetitive tasks like reporting (ExcelJS, React-PDF), email notifications (Resend), and data syncing.
